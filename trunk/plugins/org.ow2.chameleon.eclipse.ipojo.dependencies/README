This project must contain the iPOJO Core and the patched version of the iPOJO
Manipulator. It has been created in order to have an Equinox 'plugin' version
of the iPOJO Core and Manipulator JAR files.

Before iPOJO 1.8, we used to patch the iPOJO Manipulator in order to have a
stable Manifest.mf file content. This behavior was then changed in the iPOJO
project after issue FELIX-3131.
See: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX-3131

The "constant-output.patch" we used can be seen in the Git history of this
project, at commit 3f42274af35a645368943f7bea210c0f5001e66c.
It replaces a HashMap by a TreeMap to conserve the order of the Elements and
their attributes over manipulations.
