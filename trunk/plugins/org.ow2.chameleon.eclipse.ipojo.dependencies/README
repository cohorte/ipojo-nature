This project must contain the iPOJO Core and the patched version of the iPOJO
Manipulator. It has been created in order to have an Equinox 'plugin' version
of the iPOJO Core and Manipulator JAR files.

The constant-output.patch contains the patch to be applied on ipojo project
group root in order to have a stable Manifest.mf file content.
It uses TreeMap and LinkedHashMap instead of HashMap to conserve the Elements
and Elements' attributes order over manipulations.
