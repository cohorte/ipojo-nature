This project must contain the iPOJO Core and the patched version of the iPOJO
Manipulator. It has been created in order to have an Equinox 'plugin' version
of the iPOJO Core and Manipulator JAR files.

Place the org and xsd folder from the JAR files in the root folder of this
project (or modify the build.properties file) to be able to build it.

Use the patch.manipulator file to generate the patched version of the
Manipulator from the Manipulator project in the Felix trunk.
