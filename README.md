An Eclipse plug-in to do the iPOJO manipulation right after the JDT compilation.
It allows to use an OSGi Run Configuration without having to do the pojoization separately with Maven or another tool.

Forked from http://gitorious.ow2.org/ow2-chameleon/eclipse-ipojo-builder

WIP: an M2E iPojo Configurator that coupled with the M2E Tycho Configurator will add the proper Eclipse project nature so that iPojo components are built 'on-the-fly'.
